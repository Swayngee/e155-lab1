    "text": "Initial reaction to Lab 1 of Microp? It was alot. The code itself wasnt that bad, but the software we used to program the FPGA was just horrible. It took around 10 minutes to load each time, and when you finally were able to load it, it would not recognize your FPGA was plugged in unless you crashed the site 100 times.\nOnce you get past this leap, everything else was pretty easy. Questa ran as normal, and running the testbenches were pretty fun. The hardware itself was fun to solder, and overall put together. I had one mishap where a wire in my circuit was faulty, and it took me an hour to debug, but thats the engineering process. I put fourth a lot of effort into this lab having been doing it for aorund 18 hours. It was rewarding when it was finally completed and I updated all of the side specifications."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this lab, a development board incorporating an MCU, an FPGA, and LEDs was created as the platform for exploring embedded systems. A design was implemented on the FPGA to control a 7-segment LED display and three individual LEDs. Once this lab is completed, four switches will have the capability of displaying all hexadecimal digits on the 7-segment display, and will be able to control two other LED’s based on combinational logic. The third LED will be controlled by a High-Speed Oscillator (HSOSC) have have a blink frequency of 2.4Hz.\nThe design was developed using SystemVerilog, a hardware description language, and was tested using Intels Questa, a logic waveform simulator."

Within the FPGA is pictured an AND gate, an XOR gate, an HSOSC (used as a clock divider), and a combinational logic block used to light our LED’s.\nWiring Schematic\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This schematic shows the wiring and components between our dev board and the 7-segment display\n\n\nFigure 2 above pictures the electrical circuit related to the FPGA and the 7-segment display. It portrays both modules along with the pins used for each module, and the necessary switches, LED’s, and pull down resistors needed. All output LED’s used were connected to 1kΩ resistors to limit the input current directed toward the FPGA."

    "text": "Results and Discussion\nThe design implemented onto the FPGA met the primary objective of this lab, which was to display hexadecimal digits on the 7-segment display and control three onboard LEDs. The design created was also very accurate in its ability to display all sixteen hexadecimal values clearly, with each digit easily distinguishable from the others. The timing performance was reliable, and no noticeable delays or glitches occurred during operation. Furthermore, all three LED’s responded correctly to the switch inputs which showed that the logic was implemented correctly on the FPGA.\n\nTestbench Simulation\nThe following simulations were run on Intel’s Questa. This was done to visually see the waveforms created as a result of the logic used. To complete this simulation, a testbench was created to run test vectors through the logic created. Every couple of clock cycles a new combination of switches will be ran through the logic to test accuracy. The testbench then records the clock, the inputs, the outputs, and the expected outputs based on the test vectors.\n7-segment Display Simulation\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Above pictures the waveforms corresponding to the combinational logic used for the 7-segment display\n\n\nAbove shows a successful simulation of our 7-segment display. Each output corresponds to the expected output which shows correct usage of combinational logic within out 7-segment module.\nLED Display Simulation\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Above pictures the waveforms corresponding to the logic used for flashing Led[0] and Led[1]\n\n\nAbove again shows a successful simulation but for the three LED’s. Each output again corresponds to the expected output which suggests that our LED’s will perform correctly when wired together. Not pictured above is Led[2], which was validated using an oscilliscope.\nTop Module Simulation\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Above pictures the waveforms corresponding to the top module for the implemented design\n\n\nAbove is the overall module from our implemented design. It shows both outputs, their expected values, and the input into our system. This simulation was another success based on our outputs and the expected outputs from our test vectors."

    "text": "AI Prototype\n\nBelow is the code generated from Claude, an LLM specializing in programming.\nmodule led_blinker ( output logic led );\n// Internal oscillator clock signal\nlogic clk_48mhz;\n\n// Counter for frequency division\n// 48MHz / 2Hz = 24M counts per half period\n// Need 25 bits to count up to 24M (2^25 = 33.5M)\nlogic [24:0] counter;\n\n// LED state register\nlogic led_state;\n\n// Instantiate the internal high-frequency oscillator\n// HFOSC primitive for UP5K - runs at 48 MHz\nSB_HFOSC #(\n    .CLKHF_DIV(\"0b00\")  // No division, full 48 MHz\n) hfosc_inst (\n    .CLKHFPU(1'b1),     // Power up the oscillator\n    .CLKHFEN(1'b1),     // Enable the oscillator\n    .CLKHF(clk_48mhz)   // 48 MHz output clock\n);\n\n// Calculate the count needed for 2 Hz toggle (1 Hz blink)\n// 48,000,000 / 4 = 12,000,000 counts per quarter period\n// This gives us 2 Hz toggle rate (1 Hz visible blink)\nlocalparam logic [24:0] TOGGLE_COUNT = 25'd12_000_000;\n\n// Counter and LED control logic\nalways_ff @(posedge clk_48mhz) begin\n    if (counter &gt;= TOGGLE_COUNT - 1) begin\n        counter &lt;= '0;              // Reset counter using SystemVerilog syntax\n        led_state &lt;= ~led_state;    // Toggle LED state\n    end else begin\n        counter &lt;= counter + 1'b1;\n    end\nend\n\n// Output assignment\nassign led = led_state;\nendmodule\n\n\nCode Review\nThe output from the LLM from above is pretty sophisticated. It hosts the correct inputs and outputs, and the module initializes the HSOSC to blink a frequency of 2 Hz. The only problem that was encountered with the output from this LLM is that it did not get the correct clock High-Speed Oscillator library. The error can be seen below.\nINFO &lt;2043018&gt; - C:/Users/drgonzales/e155-lab1-main/fpga/src/lab1/source/impl_1/Ailab1.sv(1,8-1,14) (VERI-1018) compiling module ‘AiLab1’ WARNING &lt;2043063&gt; - C:/Users/drgonzales/e155-lab1-main/fpga/src/lab1/source/impl_1/Ailab1.sv(18,5-24,7) (VERI-1063) instantiating unknown module ‘SB_HFOSC’ Done: design load finished with (0) errors, and (4) warnings\nRadiant (the synthesizer) hosts a wide variety of libraries that pertain to different FPGA’s. Claude probably got confused on which library to use as a result. However, the overall logic generated by Claude flowed well and showed no errors on the synthesizer. Next time when using Claude, or any LLM, be sure to correctly outline which libraries to be used for each module."

    "text": "Throughout my tenure at Harvey Mudd College I have taken many classes within the engineering discipline. Most of these classes, although cool, had little to do with what I was actually passionate about, which is lithography. Lithography is a process within the chip-making industry, that etches computer chips onto silicon wafers. This process, although existing for many decades, still feels like magic to me, which is the reason I am so passionate about it.\nWithin E155 I would like to further my knowledge of computer engineering and really start grasping how micro-controllers work. Micro-controllers make up the digital world as we know it, and I want to learn how they have a specific impact in Lithography."
