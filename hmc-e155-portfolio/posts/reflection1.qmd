Initial reaction to Lab 1 of Microp? It was alot. The code itself wasnt that bad, but the software we used to program the FPGA was just horrible. It took around 10 minutes to load each time, and when you finally were able to load it, it would not recognize your FPGA was plugged in unless you crashed the site 100 times.


 Once you get past this leap, everything else was pretty easy. Questa ran as normal, and running the testbenches were pretty fun. The hardware itself was fun to solder, and overall put together. I had one mishap where a wire in my circuit was faulty, and it took me an hour to debug, but thats the engineering process. I put fourth a lot of effort into this lab having been doing it for aorund 18 hours. It was rewarding when it was finally completed and I updated all of the side specifications.
