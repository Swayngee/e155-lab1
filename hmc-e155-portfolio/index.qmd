Hello! My name is Drake Gonzales and I am a Junior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College. I am interested in studying computer and electrical engineering, with a specific focus in Lithography. This website, created with Quarto, posseses all of my work that I have completed in E155 "Microprocessor System:Design & Application"
